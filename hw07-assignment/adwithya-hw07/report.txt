In general, in this sorting algorithm we can see the the sorting algorithm speeds up when we create more threads to sort the input numbers in parallel. The number of threads that can run at the same time in a particular enviorment depend on the number of available cores to execute our program. Therefore, when the program is executed in the local machine, in which we only have 4 available cores, we don't see any speed up or see a decrease in speed up when we execute the program with 8 threads (that is because, since we dont have more than 4 cores, it has the same effect as if we were just executing it with 4 threads also because the laptop was not charging it may put a heavier load on the CPU to process the tasks). However, in the server, we do see a speedup in this case because we have more than 4 cores available to execute the program.
